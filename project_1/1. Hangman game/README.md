## Hangman game:

The program is a Hangman game.
Data structure used: function, list.
For this project one module was imported: sys, json.

Program description:

 - Before the game, the program displays the length of the keyword and the encrypted keyword.
 - In each round the program asks for a letter, or optionally you can try to guess the keyword.
 - Each time the letter appears in the keyword the letter(s) are reveled with their index.
 - If the entered letter is not in list the program will display an appropriate message.
